# Notes-ufe — devedge micro-frontend

An Angular 15 + single-spa micro-frontend wired to the open-core
[`devedge-ufe-sdk`](https://github.com/infobloxopen/devedge-ufe-sdk). Generated
by `de ufe new notes-ufe` — **correct on first run**. There are no
placeholders to rename: the app id, package name, nav group, and route are all
already `notes-ufe`.

## What you get, and why it works on the first run

- **Nav renders immediately.** The default nav item in `src/metadata.ts` uses
  group `notes-ufe`, which is registered in the dev `GroupRegistry`, and
  `assertNavContributions(...)` runs at import — a wrong group would fail LOUD
  at startup, never render nothing silently.
- **The route matches.** The app route (`app-routing.module.ts`), the manifest
  `routes` (`metadata.ts`), and the nav item `path` all agree on `/notes-ufe`.
  No accidental `path: ''` that never activates.
- **Auth is wired.** `main.ufe.ts` provides the shell-owned `SessionProvider`
  into Angular DI via `provideDevedgeSession(props.session)`; HttpClient is
  registered with the `bearerAuthInterceptor`, so API calls carry the Bearer
  token. This uFE never authenticates — the shell owns OIDC.
- **The webpack/`angular.json` wiring is clean.** A single
  `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser` build using `extra-webpack.config.js`;
  no dead `single-spa` architect targets pointing at a non-existent
  `webpack.config`.

## Install

```sh
# Once the SDK packages are published to npm:
pnpm install     # (or npm install)
```

The `@infobloxopen/devedge-ufe-*` packages are referenced by version. **Until
they are published**, link them from a local checkout of the SDK:

```sh
# From a clone of infobloxopen/devedge-ufe-sdk (built with `pnpm -r build`):
pnpm link --global   # in each packages/* dir, OR use file: overrides
# then, here:
pnpm link --global @infobloxopen/devedge-ufe-core \
  @infobloxopen/devedge-ufe-angular \
  @infobloxopen/devedge-ufe-single-spa \
  @infobloxopen/devedge-ufe-oidc \
  @infobloxopen/devedge-ufe-dev-loop
```

## Local dev loop

```sh
pnpm start                 # ng serve on https://localhost:4200
pnpm run doctor            # devedge-ufe doctor: loud checklist, not a silent fail
```

`doctor` runs the open-core `devedge-ufe doctor` against the dev server and
reports the FIRST failing step (reachability → **TLS cert trust** → CORS →
manifest → nav groups) with an actionable message.

> **Trust the dev cert.** A self-signed dev cert makes the shell fail to load
> this uFE **silently**. `doctor` isolates it as its own step. Fix it by
> trusting the cert (add it to your keychain, or set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to
> its path), or serve over plain `http` for local dev. This is the single most
> common silent-failure the dev loop catches.

To point a running shell at this local bundle, use the import-map override:

```ts
import { override } from '@infobloxopen/devedge-ufe-dev-loop';
override('notes-ufe', 'https://localhost:4200/main.js');
```

## Build & deploy

```sh
pnpm build                 # UMD bundle → dist/notes-ufe/
```

The base scaffold ships a generic static-bundle `Dockerfile`, a minimal
`deploy/manifest.yaml`, and a `charts/notes-ufe-ufe/` Helm chart. It does
**not** ship the FeatureFlag-CRD chart — that is provided by the `infoblox-cto`
preset (`de ufe new notes-ufe --preset infoblox-cto`), which lives in the
private `Infoblox-CTO/devedge-ufe-sdk-internal` repo.

## Layout

```
package.json            deps (no Angular-2-era deadweight, no committed lockfile)
angular.json            custom-webpack browser build (no dead single-spa targets)
extra-webpack.config.js UMD entries + permissive-CORS dev server
tsconfig*.json          TS config
src/main.ufe.ts         single-spa entry; provides the session into Angular DI
src/metadata.ts         validated manifest; default nav group + matching route
src/polyfills.ts        zone.js + core-js
src/app/                app.module, app.component, routing, home
Dockerfile              static-bundle image
deploy/manifest.yaml    minimal Deployment + Service
charts/notes-ufe-ufe/ minimal Helm chart
```
