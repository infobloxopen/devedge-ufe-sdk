/**
 * uFE manifest — what the Notes-ufe micro-frontend contributes to the
 * shell (nav items, routes, exports), validated at import time.
 *
 * Correct-by-construction guarantees (the bugs this scaffold eliminates):
 *   - The default NavContribution's `group` VALIDATES against the active
 *     GroupRegistry. The dev registry below includes 'notes-ufe' (our
 *     default group), so the item renders on first run — unlike a boilerplate
 *     nav item whose group matched no registered group and so rendered nothing
 *     with no error anywhere.
 *   - The nav item's `path` and the manifest `routes` MATCH the route the app
 *     actually registers ('/notes-ufe') — not the boilerplate's accidental
 *     path:'' that never activates.
 *   - assertNavContributions([...], registry) runs at module load, so a bad
 *     group fails LOUD at startup instead of rendering nothing at runtime.
