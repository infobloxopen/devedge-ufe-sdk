# notesd migrations

This directory holds the **notesd module's** schema migration files. The
module *owns* its migration files; a **host** runs them (WS-012 composable
services). The `module/module.go` `//go:embed migrations` directive embeds this
directory so a host can run these migrations under a per-module advisory lock with
per-module namespacing.

**Migration is host-run (WS-012 P2).** `cmd/notesd/main.go` passes a
`servicekit.MigrationRunner` (`moduleMigrate`) to `servicekit.Run`, which calls it —
once, before the module registers — with the module's allocated `DatabaseNamespace`.
The runner (`gormtx.MigrateModule`) acquires a per-module advisory lock (Postgres),
creates the module's schema (or applies its table prefix), AutoMigrates the domain
models plus the SDK framework tables (outbox / idempotency / dispatcher sidecars)
**into the module namespace**, and stamps the module's own `schema_migrations` table.
A module **never** runs migrations from `init()`, never assumes it owns the whole DB,
and never creates a cross-module foreign key.

For a **standalone** host the module shares its database with no one, so its
namespace is a zero (bare-table) namespace and tables are unqualified — unchanged
from a non-composable service. When this service is composed into a **suite** host
(`de compose`), that host declares a shared engine and each module gets its own
schema/prefix — the SAME runner, no module change.

This README is also the placeholder that keeps the `//go:embed migrations` valid
before the first migration file lands. Add migration files here (e.g.
`0001_init.up.sql` / `0001_init.down.sql`) as your schema evolves; the host-run
migrator reads them through the embedded `Migrations()` FS.
